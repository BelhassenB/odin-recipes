            <h3>Description</h3> 
            <p>Dwida mfawra is a specialty of Jijel, a beautiful coastal city of Algeria, in the northeast of the country. Adapted from the Algerians, dwida is a pasta that is made by hand. It is basically the same dough used for trida.</p>
            <p>As a result of the time it takes, hand rolled pasta is often being replaced by broken thin vermicelli (fideo). It is fast, practical and it gives the same delicious result. But it's certainly a treasure to master the original technique</p>

            <li>4 hard boiled eggs</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>20 oz. thin fideo (cut vermicelli)</li>
            <li>½ cup dried chickpeas (soaked for 12 hours)</li>
            <li>4 small potatoes , cut in half</li>
            <li>4 green hot peppers</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 onions , thinly sliced</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic , pressed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon harissa</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon turmeric</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon tabel karwiya (spice blend)</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>5 cups water (boiling)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In the lower part of a couscous steamer (double boiler), heat 4 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat and cook the onion for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and stir well.</li>
            <li>Add the lamb chunks and chickpeas and fry for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato paste, harissa, tabel, coriander, and turmeric and sauté again for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 2½ cups (600ml) of the boiling water and simmer for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>After 20 minutes of cooking, add the potatoes. The sauce should cook for about 1 hour. If, during this time, it becomes too concentrated or it is about to stick to the bottom and burn, add boiling water and simmer.</li>
            <li>Pour the fideo into a large container, add the vegetable oil and mix by hand to soak them well with this oil.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining boiling water to the sauce in the lower part of the couscoussier and place the angel hair in the upper part of the couscoussier by creating a hole in the center to allow the steam to go through. Cook for 20 to 30 minutes (depending on the thickness of the pasta).</li>
            <li>Fry the green hot peppers and peel them.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F (180˚C).</li>
            <li>Place the fideo in a baking dish and add some sauce, just enough to soak the pasta.</li>
            <li>Baking should take between 10 and 20 minutes. Pay attention to the baking time, as the pasta should not dry while baking. Add a little sauce if necessary.</li>
            <li>When serving, add the fideo in a dish, place the pieces of lamb, potatoes and chickpeas.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with sauce and decorate with the eggs (halved or quartered) and fried green hot peppers on top.</li>

        </ol>
